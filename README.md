# dungeon
A very simple randomly generated game in which a group of knights scale a tower. Walk using the arrow keys, while space is the action key.

You fight by assessing enemies' weapons and walking towards them. Weapons work like rock-paper-scissors, swords beat axes, axes beat spears and spears beat swords. 
Taking enough damage charges a special attack which beats all attacks, like the controversial rule "fire beats everything" in rock-paper-scissors!

There are chests with better weapons and helpful items inside too. The shield makes you take less damage, the dagger makes you deal more, 
and the cross charges up your special attack quicker.

Made using Java in January for a college submission. The assignment was to make a simple game, as it was our first year programming, 
but I wanted to get used to making stuff so added AWT and Swing elements. 
The code is probably clunky, but I like how it works for a first attempt!

Run the game using the console in the folder where it is stored to make sure that it loads the sprites correctly.
You can also just download and run the .jar, and it should run fine too.

Have fun!
